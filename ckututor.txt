   C-KERMIT FOR UNIX 9.0 TUTORIAL

     Frank da Cruz
     The Kermit Project, Columbia University

     This document is intended to give the beginner sufficient
     information to make basic (if not advanced) use of C-Kermit 9.0.
     Although it might be rather long for a Unix manual page (about 1600
     lines), it's still far shorter than the C-Kermit manual, which
     should be consulted for advanced topics such as customization,
     character-sets, scripting, etc. We also attempt to provide a clear
     structural overview of C-Kermit's many capabilities, functional
     areas, states, and modes and their interrelation, that should be
     helpful to beginners and veterans alike, as well as to those
     upgrading to the new release. Thanks to Christine Gianone for her
     work on this document before she was laid off in 2005.

DESCRIPTION

   C-Kermit is an all-purpose communications software package from the
   Columbia University that:

     * Is portable to many platforms, Unix and non-Unix alike.
     * Can make both serial and network connections.
     * Can conduct interactive terminal sessions over its connection.
     * Can transfer text or binary files over the same connection.
     * Can convert text-file character sets in terminal mode or file
       transfer.
     * Is customizable in every aspect of its operation.

   C-Kermit is a modem program, a Telnet client, an Rlogin client, an FTP
   client, an HTTP client, and on selected platforms, also an X.25 client.
   It can make its own secure Internet connections using IETF-approved
   security methods including Kerberos IV, Kerberos V, SSL/TLS, and SRP
   and it can also make SSH (Secure Shell) connections through your
   external SSH client application. It can be the far-end file-transfer or
   client/server partner of your desktop Kermit client. It can also accept
   incoming dialed and network connections. It can even be installed as an
   Internet service on its own standard TCP socket, RFC2839.

   And perhaps most important, everything you can do "by hand"
   (interactively) with C-Kermit, can be "scripted" (automated) using its
   built-in cross-platform transport-independent script programming
   language, which happens to be identical to its interactive command
   language.

   This manual page offers an overview of C-Kermit 9.0 for Unix ("Unix" is
   an operating system family that includes AIX, DG/UX, FreeBSD, HP-UX,
   IRIX, Linux, Mac OS X, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Open Server, Open Unix, QNX,
   Solaris, SunOS, System V R3, System V R4, Tru64 Unix, Unixware, Xenix,
   and many others). For thorough coverage, please consult the published
   C-Kermit manual and supplements (see DOCUMENTATION below). For
   further information about C-Kermit, Kermit software for other
   platforms, and Kermit manuals, visit the Kermit Project website:

  http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/

   This is a longer-than-average manual page, and yet it barely scratches
   the surface. Don't be daunted. C-Kermit is a large and complex package,
   evolving over decades of practice and experience, but that doesn't mean
   it's hard to learn or use. Its most commonly used functions are
   explained here with pointers to additional information elsewhere.

SYNOPSIS

   Usage:  kermit ...
   Or:     kermit URL

   If the first command-line argument is the name of a file,
   interactive-mode commands are executed from the file. The '=' (or "--")
   argument tells Kermit not to parse the remainder of the command line,
   but to make the words following '=' available as \%1, \%2, ... \%9. The
   "+" argument is like "=" but for use in "kerbang scripts" (explained
   below). A second command-line format allows the one and only
   argument to be a Telnet, FTP, HTTP, or IKSD URL.

   Order of execution:

    The command file (if any).
    The initialization file, if any, unless suppressed with -Y.
    The customization file (if it is executed by the initialization
       file).
    The command-line URL (if any, and if so, execution stops here).
    Command-line options (if any).
    Interactive commands.

   Some command-line options can cause actions (such as -s to send a
   file); others just set parameters. If any action options are included
   on the command line, Kermit exits when finished unless also given the
   -S ("stay") option. If no action options are given, no initialization
   or command files contained an EXIT or QUIT command, and no fatal errors
   occurred, Kermit issues its prompt and waits for you to type commands.

     Bear in mind that C-Kermit can be built with selected features
     disabled, and also that certain features are not available on all
     platforms. For example, C-Kermit can't be built with TCP/IP support
     on a platform that does not have TCP/IP header files and libraries
     (and even if Kermit does include TCP/IP support, it can't be used to
     make TCP/IP connections on a computer that does not have a TCP/IP
     stack installed). If your version of C-Kermit lacks a feature
     mentioned here, use its SHOW FEATURES command to see what might have
     been excluded.

   C-Kermit has three kinds of commands: regular single-letter
   command-line options, extended-format command-line options, and
   interactive commands.

OPTIONS

   Like most Unix commands, C-Kermit can be be given options on the
   command line. But C-Kermit also can be used interactively by giving it
   commands composed of words, which are more intuitive than cryptic
   command-line options, and more flexible too. In other words, you don't
   have to use C-Kermit's command-line options, but they are available if
   you want to. (By the same token, you don't have to use its interactive
   commands either -- you can use either or both in any combination.)

   C-Kermit is generally installed in the PATH as "kermit", and therefore
   is invoked by typing the word "kermit" (lowercase) at the shell prompt,
   and then pressing the Return or Enter key. If you wish to include
   command-line options, put them after the word "kermit" but before
   pressing Return or Enter, separated by spaces, for example:

  $ kermit -s ckermit.tar.gz

   ('$' is the shell prompt; "kermit -s ckermit.tar.gz" is what you type,
   followed by Return or Enter.)

   Here is a list of C-Kermit's single-letter command-line options, which
   start with a single dash (-), in ASCII ("alphabetical") order.
   Alphabetic case is significant (-A is not the same as -a). The Action?
   column contains Y for action options and N for non-action options.

   Option Action Description
   -0 N (digit zero) 100% transparent Connect state for "in-the-middle"
   operation: 8 bits, no parity, no escape character, everything passes
   through.
   -8 N (digit eight) Connection is 8-bit clean (this is the default in
   C-Kermit 9.0). Equivalent to the EIGHTBIT command, which in turn is a
   shortcut for SET TERMINAL BYTESIZE 8, SET COMMAND BYTESIZE 8, SET
   PARITY NONE.
   -9 arg N (digit nine) Make a connection to an FTP server. Equivalent to
   the FTP OPEN command.
   Argument: IP-address-or-hostname.
   NOTE: C-Kermit also has a separate FTP command-line personality, with
   regular FTP-like command-line syntax. More about this below.
   -A N Kermit is to be started as an Internet service (IKSD) (only from
   inetd.conf).
   -B N Kermit is running in Batch or Background (no controlling
   terminal). To be used in case Kermit doesn't automatically sense its
   background status. Equivalent to the SET BACKGROUND ON command.
   -C arg N Interactive-mode Commands to be executed.
   Argument: Commands separated by commas, list in doublequotes.
   -D arg N Delay before starting to send in Remote mode. Equivalent to
   the SET DELAY command.
   Argument: Number of seconds.
   -E N Exit automatically when connection closes. Equivalent to SET EXIT
   ON-DISCONNECT ON.
   -F arg N Use an open TCP connection.
   Argument: Numeric file descriptor of open TCP connection.
   Also see: -j, -J.
   -G arg Y Get file(s) from server, send contents to standard output,
   which normally would be piped to another process.
   Argument: Remote file specification, in quotes if it contains
   metacharacters.
   Also see: -g, -k.
   -H N Suppress program startup Herald and greeting.
   -I N Tell Kermit it has a reliable connection, to force streaming to be
   used where it normally would not be. Equivalent to the SET RELIABLE ON
   command.
   -J arg N "Be like Telnet." Like -j but implies -E.
   Argument: IP hostname/address optionally followed by service.
   NOTE: C-Kermit also has a separate Telnet command-line personality,
   with regular Telnet-like command-line syntax. More about this
   below.
   -L N Recursive directory descent for files in -s option.
   -M arg N My user name (for use with Telnet, Rlogin, FTP, etc).
   Equivalent to the SET LOGIN USER command.
   Argument: Username string.
   -O Y (Uppercase letter O) Be a server for One command only. Also see:
   -x.
   -P N Don't convert file (Path) names of transferred files. Equivalent
   to SET FILE NAMES LITERAL.
   -Q N Quick Kermit protocol settings. Equivalent to the FAST command.
   This is the default in C-Kermit 7.0 and later.
   -R N Remote-only (this just makes IF REMOTE true).
   -S N Stay (enter command parser after action options).
   -T N Force Text mode for file transfer; implies -V. Equivalent to SET
   TRANSFER MODE MANUAL, SET FILE TYPE TEXT.
   -V N Disable automatic per-file text/binary switching. Equivalent to
   SET TRANSFER MODE MANUAL.
   -Y N Skip (don't execute) the initialization file.
   -a arg N As-name for file(s) in -s, -r, or -g.
   Argument: As-name string (alternative filename). When receiving files,
   this can be a directory name.
   -b arg N Speed for serial device. Equivalent to SET SPEED.
   Argument: Numeric Bits per second for serial connections.
   -c Y Enter Connect state before transferring files.
   -d N Create a debug.log file with detailed debugging information (a
   second -d adds timestamps). Equivalent to LOG DEBUG but takes effect
   sooner.
   -e arg N Maximum length for incoming Kermit file-transfer packets.
   Equivalent to SET RECEIVE PACKET-LENGTH.
   Argument: Length in bytes.
   -f Y Send a FINISH command to a Kermit server.
   -g arg N Get file(s) from a Kermit server.
   Argument: File specification on other computer, in quotes if it
   contains metacharacters. Equivalent to GET.
   Also see: -a, -G, -r.
   -h Y Print Help text for single-letter command-line options (pipe thru
   'more' to prevent scrolling).
   -i N Force binary (Image) mode for file transfer; implies -V.
   Equivalent to SET TRANSFER MODE MANUAL, SET FILE TYPE BINARY.
   -j arg N Make a TCP/IP connection.
   Argument: IP host name/address and optional service name or number.
   Equivalent to the TELNET command.
   Also see: -J, -F.
   -k Y Receive file(s) to standard output, which normally would be piped
   to another process.
   Also see: -r, -G.
   -l arg N (Lowercase letter L) Make a connection on the given serial
   communications device. Equivalent to the SET LINE (SET PORT) command.
   Argument: Serial device name, e.g. /dev/ttyS0.
   -m arg N Modem type for use with the -l device. Equivalent to the SET
   MODEM TYPE command.
   Argument: Modem name as in SET MODEM TYPE command, e.g. "usrobotics".
   -n Y Enter Connect state after transferring files (historical).
   -p arg N Parity. Equivalent to the SET PARITY command.
   Argument: One of the following: e(ven), o(dd), m(ark), n(one), s(pace).
   -q N Quiet (suppress most messages). Equivalent to SET QUIET ON.
   -r Y Receive file(s). Equivalent to the RECEIVE command.
   Argument: (none, but see -a)
   -s arg N Send file(s).
   Argument: One or more local file specifications. Equivalent to the SEND
   command.
   Also see: -a.
   -t N (Historical) Xon (Ctrl-Q) Turnaround character for half-duplex
   connections (used on serial linemode connections to old mainframes).
   Equivalent to SET DUPLEX HALF, SET HANDSHAKE XON.
   -v arg N Window size for Kermit protocol (ignored when streaming).
   Equivalent to SET WINDOW-SIZE.
   Argument: Number, 1 to 32.
   -w N Incoming files Write over existing files. Equivalent to SET FILE
   COLLISION OVERWRITE.
   -x Y Enter server mode. Equivalent to the SERVER command. Also see: -O.
   -y arg N Alternative initialization file.
   Argument: Filename.
   -z N Force foreground behavior. To be used in case Kermit doesn't
   automatically sense its foreground status. Equivalent to the SET
   BACKGROUND OFF command.

   Extended command-line options (necessary because single-letter ones are
   about used up) start with two dashes (--), with words rather than
   single letters as option names. If an extended option takes an
   argument, it is separated from the option word by a colon (:). Extended
   options include:

   Option Description
   --bannerfile:filename File to display upon startup or IKSD login.
   --cdfile:filename File to be sent for display to the client when server
   changes directory (filename is relative to the changed-to directory).
   --cdmessage:{on,off} Enable/disable the server CD message feature.
   --help Prints usage message for extended options.
   --helpfile:filename Designates a file containing custom text to replace
   the top-level HELP command.
   --nointerrupts Disables keyboard interrupts.
   --noperms Disables the Kermit protocol file Permissions attribute, to
   prevent transmission of file permissions (protection) from sender to
   receiver.

   Plus several other IKSD-Only options.

   See the file-transfer section for examples of command-line
   invocation.

COMMAND LANGUAGE

     * Command Files, Macros, and Scripts
     * Command List

   C-Kermit's interactive command language is the subject of a
   622-page book and another several hundred pages of updates, far too
   much for a manual page. But it's not hard to get started. At the shell
   prompt, just type "kermit" to get C-Kermit's interactive command
   prompt:

  $ kermit
  (/current/directory) C-Kermit>

   Begin by typing "help" (and then press the Return or Enter key) for a
   top-level overview, read it, and go from there. Your second command
   should probably be "intro" (introduction). Note the prompt shows your
   current directory (unless you tell Kermit to prompt you with something
   else).

   Interactive commands are composed mainly of regular English words,
   usually in the form of imperative sentences, such as:

  send oofa.txt

   which tells Kermit to send (transfer) the file whose name is oofa.txt,
   or:

  set transfer mode automatic

   which sets Kermit's "transfer mode" to "automatic" (whatever that
   means).

   While typing commands, you can abbreviate, ask for help (by pressing
   the "?" key anywhere in a command), complete keywords or filenames
   (with the Tab or Esc key), and edit your typing with Backspace or
   Delete, Ctrl-W, Ctrl-U, etc. You can also recall previous commands,
   save your command history, and who knows what else. Give the INTRO
   command for details.

   C-Kermit has hundreds of commands, and they can be issued in infinite
   variety and combinations, including commands for:

     * Making connections (SET LINE, DIAL, TELNET, SSH, FTP, CONNECT, ...)
     * Breaking connections (HANGUP, CLOSE)
     * Transferring files (SEND, GET, RECEIVE, MOVE, RESEND, ...)
     * Establishing preferences (SET)
     * Displaying preferences (SHOW)
     * Managing local files (CD, DELETE, MKDIR, DIRECTORY, RENAME, TYPE,
       ...)
     * Managing remote files (RCD, RDEL, RMKDIR, RDIR, ...)
     * Using local files (FOPEN, FCLOSE, FREAD, FWRITE)
     * Programming (TAKE, DEFINE, IF, FOR, WHILE, SWITCH, DECLARE, ...)
     * Interacting with the user (ECHO, ASK, ...)
     * Interacting with a remote computer (INPUT, OUTPUT, ...)
     * Interacting with local programs (RUN, EXEC, PTY, ...)
     * Logging things (LOG SESSION, LOG PACKETS, LOG DEBUG, ...)

   And of course QUIT or EXIT to get out and HELP to get help, and for
   programmers: loops, decision making, variables, arrays, associative
   arrays, integer and floating point arithmetic, macros, built-in and
   user-defined functions, string manipulation, pattern matching, block
   structure, scoping, recursion, and all the rest. To get a list of all
   C-Kermit's commands, type a question mark (?) at the prompt. To get a
   description of any command, type HELP followed by the name of the
   command, for example:

  help send

   The command interruption character is Ctrl-C (hold down the Ctrl key
   and press the C key).

   The command language "escape character", used to introduce variable
   names, function invocations, and so on, is backslash (\). If you need
   to include a literal backslash in a command, type two of them, e.g.:

  get c:\\k95\\k95custom.ini

Command Files, Macros, and Scripts

   A file containing Kermit commands is called a Kermit command file or
   Kermit script. It can be executed with Kermit's TAKE command:

  (/current/dir) C-Kermit> take commandfile

   (where "commandfile" is the name of the command file). Please don't
   pipe a command file into Kermit's standard input (which might or might
   not work); if you have Kermit commands in a file, tell Kermit to TAKE
   the file.

   In Unix only, a Kermit command file can also be executed directly by
   including a "kerbang" line as the first line of the file:

  #!/usr/local/bin/kermit +

   That is, a top line that starts with "#!", followed immediately by the
   full path of the Kermit executable, and then, if the Kermit script is
   to be given arguments on the command line, a space and a plus sign. The
   script file must also have execute permission:

  chmod +x commandfile

   Except for the " +" part, this is exactly the same as you would do for
   a shell script, a Perl script, etc. Here's a simple but useless example
   script that regurgitates its arguments (up to three of them):

  #!/usr/local/bin/kermit +
  if defined \%1 echo "Argument 1: \%1"
  if defined \%2 echo "Argument 2: \%2"
  if defined \%3 echo "Argument 3: \%3"
  if defined \%4 echo "etc..."
  exit

   If this file is stored in your current directory as "commandfile",
   then:

  ./commandfile one two three four five

   prints:

  Argument 1: one
  Argument 2: two
  Argument 3: three
  etc...

   This illustrates the basic structure of a standalone Kermit script: the
   "kerbang line", then some commands. It should end with "exit" unless
   you want the Kermit prompt to appear when it is finished. \%1 is the
   first argument, \%2 the second, and so on.

   You can also create your own commands by defining named macros composed
   of other Kermit commands (or macros). Here's a simple example:

  define mydial {
      set modem type usrobotics
      set port /dev/ttyS0
      if fail end 1
      set speed 57600
      dial \%1
      if success connect
  }

   This shows how you can combine many commands into one command, "mydial"
   in this case (you can use any name you like, provided it does not clash
   with the name of a built-in command). When this macro definition is in
   effect, you can type commands like:

  mydial 7654321

   and it executes all the commands in macro definition, substituting the
   first operand ("7654321") for the formal parameter ("\%1") in the
   definition. This saves you from having to type lots of commands every
   time you want to make a modem call.

   One way to have the macro definition in effect is to type the
   definition at the Kermit prompt. Another way is to store the definition
   in a file and TAKE the file. If you want the definition to be in effect
   automatically every time you start Kermit, put the definition in your
   initialization or customization file (explained below).

   Here's a somewhat more ambitious example:

  define mydelete {
      local trash
      assign trash \v(home)trashcan/
      if not defined \%1 end 1 "Delete what?"
      if wild \%1 end 1 "Deleting multiple files is too scary"
      if not exist \%1 end 1 "I can't find \%1"
      if not directory \m(trash) {
          mkdir \m(trash)
          if fail end 1 "No trash can"
      }
      rename /list \%1 \m(trash)
  }
  define myundelete {
      local trash
      assign trash \v(home)trashcan/
      if not defined \%1 end 1 "Undelete what?"
      if wild \%1 end 1 "Undeleting multiple files is too hard"
      if not directory \m(trash) end 1 "No trash can"
      if not exist \m(trash)\%1 end 1 "I can't find \%1 in trash can"
      rename /list \m(trash)\%1 .
  }

   These macros are not exactly production quality (they don't handle
   filenames that include path segments, they don't handle multiple files,
   etc), but you get the idea: you can pass arguments to macros, they can
   check them and make other kinds of decisions, and the commands
   themselves are relatively intuitive and intelligible.

   If you put the above lines into your initialization or customization
   file, you'll have MYDELETE and MYUNDELETE commands available every time
   you start Kermit, at least as long as you don't suppress execution of
   the initialization file. (Exercise for the reader: Make these macros
   generally useful: remove limitations, add trashcan display, browsing,
   emptying, etc.)

   Kerbang scripts execute without the initialization file. This to keep
   them portable and also to make them start faster. If you want to write
   Kerbang scripts that depend on the initialization file, include the
   command

  take \v(home).kermrc

   at the desired spot in the script. By the way, \v(xxx) is a built-in
   variable (xxx is the variable name, "home" in this case). To see what
   built-in variables are available, type "show variables" at the C-Kermit
   prompt. To see what else you can show, type "show ?". \m(xxx) is a user
   defined variable (strictly speaking, it is a macro used as a variable).

Command List

   C-Kermit has more than 200 top-level commands, and some of these, such
   as SET, branch off into hundreds of subcommands of their own, so it's
   not practical to describe them all here. Instead, here's a concise list
   of the most commonly used top-level commands, grouped by category. To
   learn about each command, type "help" followed by the command name,
   e.g. "help set". Terms such as Command state and Connect state are
   explained in subsequent sections.

   Optional fields are shown in . filename means
   the name of a single file. filespec means a file specification that is
   allowed to contain wildcard characters like '*' to match groups of
   files. options are (optional) switches like /PAGE, /NOPAGE, /QUIET,
   etc, listed in the HELP text for each command. Example:

  send /recursive /larger:10000 /after:-1week /except:*.txt *

   which can be read as "send all the files in this directory and all the
   ones underneath it that are larger than 10000 bytes, no more than one
   week old, and whose names don't end with ".txt".

   Script Programming
          DEFINE, DECLARE, UNDEFINE, UNDECLARE, ASSIGN, EVALUATE,
          SEXPRESSION, ARRAY, SORT, INPUT, OUTPUT, IF, FOR, WHILE, SWITCH,
          GOTO, ECHO, ASK, GETC, GETOK, ASSERT, WAIT, SLEEP, FOPEN, FREAD,
          FWRITE, FCLOSE, STOP, END, RETURN, LEARN, SHIFT, TRACE, VOID,
          INCREMENT, DECREMENT, ... For these and many more you'll need to
          consult the manual and supplements, and/or visit the
          Kermit Script Library, which also includes a brief tutorial.
          Hint: HELP LEARN to find out how to get Kermit to write simple
          scripts for you.

   Many of Kermit's commands have synonyms, variants, relatives, and so
   on. For example, MSEND is a version of SEND that accepts a list of file
   specifications to be sent, rather than just one file specification, and
   MPUT is a synonym of MSEND. MOVE means to SEND and then DELETE the
   source file if successful. MMOVE is like MOVE, but accepts a list of
   filespecs, and so on. These are described in the full
   documentation.

   Use question mark to feel your way through an unfamiliar command, as in
   this example (the part you type is underlined):

  C-Kermit> remote ? One of the following:
   assign     delete     help       login      print      rename     space
   cd         directory  host       logout     pwd        rmdir      type
   copy       exit       kermit     mkdir      query      set        who
  C-Kermit> remote set ? One of the following:
   attributes   file         retry        transfer
   block-check  receive      server       window
  C-Kermit> remote set file ? One of the following:
   character-set  incomplete     record-length
   collision      names          type
  C-Kermit> remote set file names ? One of the following:
   converted  literal
  C-Kermit> remote set file names literal
  C-Kermit>

   This is called menu on demand: you get a menu when you want one, but
   menus are not forced on you even when know what you're doing. Note that
   you can also abbreviate most keywords, and you can complete them with
   the Tab or Esc key. Also note that ? works for filenames too, and that
   you can use it in the middle of a keyword or filename, not just at the
   beginning. For example, "send x?" lists all the files in the current
   directory whose names start with 'x'.

INITIALIZATION FILE

   In its default configuration, C-Kermit executes commands from a file
   called .kermrc in your home directory when it starts, unless it is
   given the -Y or -y command-line option. Custom configurations might
   substitute a shared system-wide initialization file. The SHOW FILE
   command tells what initialization file, if any, was used. The standard
   initialization file "chains" to an individual customization file,
   .mykermc, in the home directory, in which each user can establish
   her/his own preferences, define macros, and so on.

   Since execution of the initialization file (at least the standard one)
   makes C-Kermit take longer to start, it might be better not to have an
   initialization file, especially now that Kermit's default startup
   configuration is well attuned to modern computing and networking -- in
   other words, you no longer have do anything special to make Kermit
   transfers go fast. So instead of having an initialization file that is
   executed every time Kermit starts, you might consider making one or
   more kerbang scripts (with names other that .kermrc) that do NOT
   include an "exit" command, and invoke those when you need the settings,
   macro definitions, and/or scripted actions they contain, and invoke
   C-Kermit directly when you don't.

   To put it another way... We still distribute the standard
   initialization file since it's featured in the manual and backwards
   compatibility is important to us. But there's no harm in not using it
   if you don't need the stuff that's in it (services directory, dialing
   directory, network directory, and associated macro definitions). On the
   other hand, if there are settings or macros you want in effect EVERY
   time you use Kermit, the initialization file (or the customization file
   it chains to) is the place to put them, because that's the only place
   Kermit looks for them automatically each time you start it.

MODES OF OPERATION

   Kermit is said to be in Local mode if it has made a connection to
   another computer, e.g. by dialing it or establishing a Telnet
   connection to it. The other computer is remote, so if you start another
   copy of Kermit on the remote computer, it is said to be in Remote mode
   (as long as it has not made any connections of its own). The local
   Kermit communicates over the communications device or network
   connection, acting as a conduit between the the remote computer and
   your keyboard and screen. The remote Kermit is the file-transfer
   partner to the local Kermit and communicates only through its standard
   input and output.

   At any moment, a Kermit program can be in any of the following states.
   It's important to know what they are and how to change from one to the
   other.

   Command state
          In this state, Kermit reads commands from:

          + Your keyboard; or:
          + A file, or:
          + A macro definition.

          You can exit from Command state back to Unix with the EXIT or
          QUIT command (same thing). You can enter Connect state with any
          of various commands (CONNECT, DIAL, TELNET, etc). You can enter
          file transfer state with commands like SEND, RECEIVE, and GET.
          You can enter Server state with the SERVER command. The TAKE
          command tells Kermit to read and execute commands from a file.
          The (perhaps implied) DO command tells Kermit to read and
          execute commands from a macro definition. While in Command
          state, you can interrupt any command, macro, or command file by
          typing Ctrl-C (hold down the Ctrl key and press the C key); this
          normally brings you back to the prompt.

   Shell state
          You can invoke an inferior shell or external command from the
          Kermit command prompt by using the PUSH, RUN (!), EDIT, or
          BROWSE command. While the inferior shell or command is active,
          Kermit is suspended and does nothing. Return to Kermit Command
          state by exiting from the inferior shell or application.

   Connect state
          In this state, which can be entered only when in Local mode
          (i.e. when Kermit has made a connection to another computer),
          Kermit is acting as a terminal to the remote computer. Your
          keystrokes are sent to the remote computer and characters that
          arrive over the communication connection are displayed on your
          screen. This state is entered when you give a CONNECT, DIAL,
          TELNET, RLOGIN, or IKSD command. You can return to command state
          by logging out of the remote computer, or by typing:

  Ctrl-\c

          That is: Hold down the Ctrl key and press the backslash key,
          then let go of the Ctrl key and press the C key. This is called
          escaping back. Certain other escape-level commands are also
          provided; type Ctrl-\? for a list. For example, you can enter
          Shell state with:

  Ctrl-\!

          To send a Ctrl-\ to the host while in Connect state, type two of
          them in a row. See HELP CONNECT and HELP SET ESCAPE for more
          info.

   Local file-transfer state
          In this state, Kermit is sending packets back and forth with the
          other computer in order to transfer a file or accomplish some
          other file-related task. And at the same time, it is displaying
          its progress on your screen and watching your keyboard for
          interruptions. In this state, the following single-keystroke
          commands are accepted:

      X        Interrupt the current file and go on to the next (if any).
      Z        Interrupt the current file and skip all the rest.
      E        Like Z but uses a "stronger" protocol (use if X or Z don't work).
      Ctrl-C   Interrupt file-transfer mode (use if Z or E don't work).

          Kermit returns to its previous state (Command or Connect) when
          the transfer is complete or when interrupted successfully by X,
          Z, E, or Ctrl-C (hold down the Ctrl key and press the C key).

   Remote file-transfer state
          In this state, Kermit is exchanging file-transfer packets with
          its local partner over its standard i/o. It leaves this state
          automatically when the transfer is complete. In case you find
          your local Kermit in Connect state and the remote one in
          File-transfer state (in which it seems to ignore your
          keystrokes), you can usually return it to command state by
          typing three Ctrl-C's in a row. If that doesn't work, return
          your local Kermit to Command state (Ctrl-\ C) and type
          "e-packet" and then press the Return or Enter key; this forces a
          fatal Kermit protocol error.

   Remote Server state
          This is like Remote File-transfer state, except it never returns
          automatically to Command state. Rather, it awaits further
          instructions from the client program; that is, from your Local
          Kermit program. You can return the Remote Server to its previous
          state by issuing a "finish" command to the client, or if you are
          in Connect state, by typing three Ctrl-C's in a row. You can
          tell the server job to log out and break the connection by
          issuing a "bye" command to the client.

   Local Server state
          Like Remote-Server state, but in local mode, and therefore with
          its file-transfer display showing, and listening for single-key
          commands, as in Local File-transfer state. Usually this state is
          entered automatically when a remote Kermit program gives a GET
          command.

   C-Kermit, Kermit 95, and MS-DOS Kermit all can switch automatically
   from Connect state to Local File-transfer state when you initiate a
   file transfer from the remote computer by starting Kermit and telling
   it to send or get a file, in which case, Connect state is automatically
   resumed after the file transfer is finished.

   Note that C-Kermit is not a terminal emulator. It is a communications
   application that you run in a terminal window (e.g. console or Xterm).
   The specific emulation, such as VT100, VT220, Linux Console, or Xterm,
   is provided by the terminal window in which you are running C-Kermit.
   Kermit 95 and MS-DOS Kermit, on the other hand, are true terminal
   emulators. Why is C-Kermit not a terminal emulator? CLICK HERE to
   read about it.

MAKING CONNECTIONS

   Here is how to make different kinds of connections using interactive
   Kermit commands (as noted above, you can also make connections with
   command-line options). Note that you don't have to make connections
   with Kermit. It can also be used on the far end of a connection as the
   remote file transfer and management partner of your local
   communications software.

   Making a Telnet Connection
          At the C-Kermit command prompt, simply type:

  telnet foo.bar.com         ; Substitute desired host name or address.
  telnet xyzcorp.com 3000    ; You can also include a port number.

          If the connection is successful, Kermit automatically enters
          Connect state. When you logout from the remote host, Kermit
          automatically returns to its prompt. More info: HELP TELNET,
          HELP SET TELNET, HELP SET TELOPT. Also see the IKSD section
          below.

   Making an Rlogin connection
          This is just like Telnet, except you have to be root to do it
          because Rlogin uses a privileged TCP port:

  rlogin foo.bar.com         ; Substitute desired host name or address.

          More info: HELP RLOGIN.

   Making an SSH Connection
          Unlike Telnet and Rlogin, SSH connections are not built-in, but
          handled by running your external SSH client through a
          pseudoterminal. Using C-Kermit to control the SSH client gives
          you all of Kermit's features (file transfer, character-set
          conversion, scripting, etc) over SSH.

  ssh foo.bar.com            ; Substitute desired host name or address.

          More info: HELP SSH, HELP SET SSH.

   Dialing with a Modem
          If it's an external modem, make sure it is connected to a usable
          serial port on your computer with a regular (straight-through)
          modem cable, and to the telephone jack with a telephone
          cable, and that it's turned on. Then use these commands:

  set modem type usrobotics  ; Or other supported type
  set line /dev/ttyS0        ; Specify device name
  set speed 57600            ; Or other desired speed
  set flow rts/cts           ; Most modern modems support this
  set dial method tone       ; (or pulse)
  dial 7654321               ; Dial the desired number

          Type "set modem type ?" for a list of supported modem types. If
          you omit the SET MODEM TYPE command, the default type is
          "generic-high-speed", which should work for most modern
          AT-command-set modems. If the line is busy, Kermit redials
          automatically. If the call does not succeed, use "set dial
          display on" and try it again to watch what happens. If the call
          succeeds, Kermit enters Connect state automatically and returns
          to its prompt automatically when you log out from the remote
          computer or the connection is otherwise lost.

          You can also dial from a modem that is accessible by Telnet,
          e.g. to a reverse terminal server. In this case the command
          sequence is:

  set host ts.xxx.com 2000   ; Terminal-server and port
  set modem type usrobotics  ; Or other supported type
  set dial method tone       ; (or pulse)
  dial 7654321               ; Dial the desired number

          If the terminal server supports the Telnet Com Port Option,
          RFC 2217, you can also give serial-port related commands
          such as SET SPEED, SET PARITY, and so on, and Kermit relays them
          to the terminal server using the protocol specified in the RFC.

          More info: HELP SET MODEM, HELP SET LINE, HELP SET SPEED, HELP
          SET FLOW, HELP DIAL, HELP SET DIAL, HELP SET MODEM, HELP SET
          CARRIER-WATCH, SHOW COMMUNICATIONS, SHOW MODEM, SHOW DIAL.

   Direct Serial Port
          Connect the two computers, A and B, with a null modem cable
          (or two modem cables interconnected with a null-modem adapter or
          modem eliminator). From Computer A:

  set modem type none        ; There is no modem
  set line /dev/ttyS0        ; Specify device name
  set carrier-watch off      ; If DTR and CD are not cross-connected
  set speed 57600            ; Or other desired speed
  set flow rts/cts           ; If RTS and CTS are cross-connected
  set flow xon/xoff          ; If you can't use RTS/CTS
  set parity even            ; (or "mark" or "space", if necessary)
  set stop-bits 2            ; (rarely necessary)
  connect                    ; Enter Connect (terminal) state

          This assumes Computer B is set up to let you log in. If it
          isn't, you can run a copy of Kermit on Computer B and follow
          approximately the same directions. More info: As above plus HELP
          CONNECT.

   With modems or direct serial connections, you might also have to "set
   parity even" (or "mark" or "space") if it's a 7-bit connection.

   Of the connection types listed above, only one can be open at a time.
   However, any one of these can be open concurrently with an FTP or
   HTTP session. Each connection type can be customized to any desired
   degree, scripted, logged, you name it. See the manual.

   NOTE: On selected platforms, C-Kermit also can make X.25 connections.
   See the manual for details.

TRANSFERRING FILES WITH KERMIT

     * Downloading Files
     * Uploading Files
     * Kermit Transfers the Old-Fashioned Way
     * If File Transfer Fails
     * Advanced Kermit File Transfer Features
     * Non-Kermit File Transfer

   There is a widespread and persistent belief that Kermit is a slow
   protocol. This is because, until recently, it used conservative tuning
   by default to make sure file transfers succeeded, rather than failing
   because they overloaded the connection. Some extra commands (or
   command-line options, like -Q) were needed to make it go fast, but
   nobody bothered to find out about them. Also, it takes two to tango:
   most non-Kermit-Project Kermit protocol implementations really ARE
   slow. The best file-transfer partners for C-Kermit are: another copy of
   Kermit 95. These combinations
   work well and they work fast by default. MS-DOS Kermit is good too, but
   you have to tell it to go fast (by giving it the FAST command).

   Furthermore, all three of these Kermit programs support "autodownload"
   and "autoupload", meaning that when they are in Connect state and a
   Kermit packet comes in from the remote, they automatically switch into
   file transfer mode.

   And plus, C-Kermit and K95 also switch automatically between text and
   binary mode for each file, so there is no need to "set file type
   binary" or "set file type text", or to worry about files being
   corrupted because they were transferred in the wrong mode.

   What all of these words add up to is that now, when you use up-to-date
   Kermit software from the Kermit Project, file transfer is not only
   fast, it's ridiculously easy. You barely have to give any commands at
   all.

   Downloading Files
          Let's say you have MS-DOS
          Kermit on your desktop computer, with a connection to a Unix
          computer that has C-Kermit installed as "kermit". To download a
          file (send it from Unix to your desktop computer), just type the
          following command at your Unix shell prompt:

  kermit -s oofa.txt

          (where oofa.txt is the filename). If you want to send more than
          one file, you can put as many filenames as you want on the
          command line, and they can be any combination of text and
          binary:

  kermit -s oofa.txt oofa.zip oofa.html oofa.tar.gz

          and/or you can use wildcards to send groups of files:

  kermit -s oofa.*

          If you want to send a file under an assumed name, use:

  kermit -s friday.txt -a today.txt

          This sends the file friday.txt but tells the receiving Kermit
          that its name is today.txt. In all cases, as noted, when the
          file transfer is finished, your desktop Kermit returns
          automatically to Connect state. No worries about escaping back,
          re-connecting, text/binary mode switching. Almost too easy,
          right?

   Uploading Files
          To upload files (send them from your desktop computer to the
          remote Unix computer) do the same thing, but use the -g (GET)
          option instead of -s:

  kermit -g oofa.txt

          This causes your local Kermit to enter server mode; then the
          remote Kermit program requests the named file and the local
          Kermit sends it and returns automatically to Connect state when
          done.

          If you want to upload multiple files, you have have use shell
          quoting rules, since these aren't local files:

  kermit -g "oofa.txt oofa.zip oofa.html oofa.tar.gz"
  kermit -g "oofa.*"

          If you want to upload a file but store it under a different
          name, use:

  kermit -g friday.txt -a today.txt

   Kermit Transfers the Old-Fashioned Way
          If your desktop communications software does not support
          autoupload or autodownload, or it does not include Kermit server
          mode, the procedure requires more steps.

          To download a file, type:

  kermit -s filename

          on the host as before, but if nothing happens automatically in
          response to this command, you have to switch your desktop
          communications software into Kermit Receive state. This might be
          done by escaping back using keyboard characters or hot keys
          (Alt-x is typical) and/or with a command (like RECEIVE) or a
          menu. When the file transfer is complete, you have to go back to
          Connect state, Terminal emulation, or whatever terminology
          applies to your desktop communications software.

          To upload a file, type:

  kermit -r

          on the host (rather than "kermit -g"). This tells C-Kermit to
          wait passively for a file to start arriving. Then regain the
          attention of your desktop software (Alt-x or whatever) and
          instruct it to send the desired file(s) with Kermit protocol.
          When the transfer is finished, return to the Connect or Terminal
          screen.

   If File Transfer Fails
          Although every aspect of Kermit's operation can be finely tuned,
          there are also three short and simple "omnibus tuning" commands
          you can use for troubleshooting:

        FAST
                Use fast file-transfer settings. This has been the default
                since C-Kermit 7.0 now that most modern computers and
                connections support it. If transfers fail with fast
                settings, try . . .

        CAUTIOUS
                Use cautious but not paranoid settings. File transfers, if
                they work, will go at medium speed. If not, try . . .

        ROBUST
                Use the most robust, resilient, conservative, safe, and
                reliable settings. File transfers will almost certainly
                work, but they will be quite slow (of course this is a
                classic tradeoff; ROBUST was C-Kermit's default tuning in
                versions 6.0 and earlier, which made everybody think
                Kermit protocol was slow). If ROBUST doesn't do the trick,
                try again with SET PARITY SPACE first in case it's not an
                8-bit connection.

          Obviously the success and performance of a file transfer also
          depends on C-Kermit's file transfer partner. Up-to-date, real
          Kermit Project partners are recommended because they
          contain the best Kermit protocol implementations and because
          we can support them in case of trouble.

          If you still have trouble, consult Chapter Using
          C-Kermit, or send email to kermit-support@columbia.edu.

   Advanced Kermit File-Transfer Features
          Obviously there is a lot more to Kermit file transfer, including
          all sorts of interactive commands, preferences, options,
          logging, debugging, troubleshooting, and anything else you can
          imagine but that's what the manual and updates are for.
          Here are a few topics you can explore if you're interested by
          Typing HELP for the listed commands:

        Logging transfers:
                LOG TRANSACTIONS (HELP LOG)

        Automatic per-file text/binary mode switching:
                SET TRANSFER MODE { AUTOMATIC, MANUAL } (HELP SET
                TRANSFER).

        Cross-platform recursive directory tree transfer:
                SEND /RECURSIVE, GET /RECURSIVE (HELP SEND, HELP GET).

        File collision options:
                SET FILE COLLISION { OVERWRITE, BACKUP, DISCARD, ... }
                (HELP SET FILE).

        Update mode (only transfer files that changed since last time):
                SET FILE COLLISION UPDATE (HELP SET FILE).

        Filename selection patterns:
                (HELP WILDCARD).

        Flexible file selection:
                SEND (or GET) /BEFORE /AFTER /LARGER /SMALLER /TYPE
                /EXCEPT, ...

        Character-set conversion:
                SET { FILE, TRANSFER } CHARACTER-SET, ASSOCIATE, ...

        File/Pathname control:
                SET { SEND, RECEIVE } PATHNAMES, SET FILE NAMES.

        Atomic file movement:
                SEND (or GET) /DELETE /RENAME /MOVE-TO

        Transferring to/from standard i/o of other commands:
                SEND (or GET) /COMMAND

        Recovery of interrupted transfer from point of failure:
                RESEND, REGET (HELP RESEND, HELP REGET).

   Non-Kermit File Transfer
          You can also use C-Kermit to transfer files with FTP or HTTP
          Internet protocols; see below.

          On a regular serial or Telnet connection where the other
          computer doesn't support Kermit protocol at all, you have
          several options. For example, if your desktop communications
          software supports Zmodem, use "rz" and "sz" on the host rather
          than Kermit. But if Kermit is your desktop software, and you are
          using it to make calls or network connections to other computers
          that don't support Kermit protocol (or that don't have a good
          implementation of it), then if your computer also has external
          X, Y, or Zmodem programs that are redirectable, Kermit can use
          them as external protocols. HELP SET PROTOCOL for details.

          You can also capture "raw" data streams from the other computer
          with LOG SESSION (HELP LOG and HELP SET SESSION-LOG for
          details), and you can upload files without any protocol at all
          with TRANSMIT (HELP TRANSMIT, HELP SET TRANSMIT).

KERMIT CLIENT/SERVER CONNECTIONS

   On any kind of connection you can make with Kermit -- serial, TCP/IP,
   X.25, etc -- you can set up a convenient client/server relationship
   between your Kermit client (the one that made the connection) and the
   Kermit program on the far end of the connection (the remote Kermit) by
   putting the remote Kermit in server mode. This is normally done by
   giving it a SERVER command, or by starting it with the -x command-line
   option. In some cases (Internet Kermit Service, SSH connections to
   a Kermit subsystem, or specially configured hosts), there is already a
   Kermit server waiting on the far end. Here is a quick synopsis of the
   commands you can give to the client for interacting with the server:

   SEND  filename
          Sends the named file to the server. The filename can include
          wildcards. Lots of switches are available for file selection,
          etc. Type HELP SEND at the client prompt for details.

   GET  filename
          Asks the server to send the named file. The filename can include
          wildcards. Type HELP GET at the client prompt for details.

   BYE
          Terminates the server and closes your connection to it.

   FINISH
          Terminates the server. If you started the server yourself, this
          leaves the remote host at its shell prompt. If it was a
          dedicated server (such as IKSD or an SSH subsystem), FINISH is
          equivalent to BYE.

   SET LOCUS { LOCAL, REMOTE, AUTO }
          (C-Kermit 8.0.201 and later, K95 1.1.21 and later) This tells
          the client whether file-management commands like CD, PWD,
          DIRECTORY, DELETE, MKDIR, etc, should be executed locally or by
          the server. In this type of connection, the default is LOCAL.
          Use SET LOCUS REMOTE if you want Kermit to behave like an FTP
          client, in which case these commands are executed remotely, and
          their local versions must have an L prefix: LCD, LPWD,
          LDIRECTORY, etc. When LOCUS is LOCAL, then the remote versions
          must have an R prefix: RCD, RPWD, RDIRECTORY, etc. HELP SET
          LOCUS for details. SHOW COMMAND to see current locus.

   The following commands are affected by SET LOCUS:

   CD, LCD, RCD
          Change (working, current) directory. HELP CD for details.

   CDUP, LCDUP, RCDUP
          CD one level up.

   DIRECTORY, LDIRECTORY, RDIRECTORY
          Produce a directory listing. Many options are available for
          local listings. HELP DIRECTORY for details.

   DELETE, LDELETE, RDELETE
          Deletes files or directories. Many options available, HELP
          DELETE.

   RENAME, LRENAME, RRENAME
          Renames files or directories. Many options available, HELP
          RENAME.

   MKDIR, LMKDIR, RMKDIR
          Creates a directory. HELP MKDIR.

   RMDIR, LRMDIR, RRMDIR
          Removes a directory. HELP RMDIR.

   There are dozens -- maybe hundreds -- of other commands, described in
   the built-in help, on the website, and/or in the published or online
   manuals. But even if you don't have access to documentation, you can
   "set locus remote" and then use pretty much the same commands you would
   use with any FTP client.

KERMIT'S BUILT-IN FTP AND HTTP CLIENTS

   Kermit's FTP client is like the regular Unix FTP client that you're
   used to, but with some differences:

     * It has lots more commands and features.
     * You can have an FTP session and a regular Kermit serial or Telnet
       session open at the same time.
     * FTP sessions can be fully automated.

   By default Kermit's FTP client tries its best to present the same user
   interface as a regular FTP client: PUT, GET, DIR, CD, BYE, etc, should
   work the same, even though some of these commands have different
   meaning in Kermit-to-Kermit connections; for example, CD, DIR, RENAME,
   etc, in Kermit act locally, whereas in FTP they are commands for the
   server. This might cause some confusion, but as in all things Kermit,
   you have total control:

     * The SET LOCUS command lets you specify where file management
       commands should be executed -- locally or remotely -- for any kind
       of connection.
     * Any FTP command can be prefixed with the word "FTP" to remove any
       ambiguity.

   Pending publication of the next edition of the manual, the Kermit FTP
   client is thoroughly documented at the Kermit Project website:

  http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/ftpclient.html

   You also can use HELP FTP and HELP SET FTP to get descriptions of
   Kermit's FTP-related commands.

   The HTTP client is similar to the FTP one, except you prefix each
   command with HTTP instead of FTP: HTTP OPEN, HTTP GET, HTTP PUT, HTTP
   CLOSE, etc. Type HELP HTTP for details, or visit the to view the
   manual supplements. HTTP connections can be open at the same time
   as regular serial or Telnet connections and FTP connections. So Kermit
   can manage up to three types connections simultaneously.

   FTP Client
   HTTP Client

INTERNET KERMIT SERVICE

   C-Kermit can be configured and run as an Internet service (called
   IKSD), similar to an FTP server (FTPD) except you can (but need not)
   interact with it directly, plus it does a lot more than an FTP server
   can do. The TCP port for IKSD is 1649. It uses Telnet protocol.
   C-Kermit can be an Internet Kermit Server, or it can be a client of an
   IKSD. You can make connections from C-Kermit to an IKSD with any of the
   following commands:

  telnet foo.bar.edu 1649
  telnet foo.bar.edu kermit   ; if "kermit" is listed in /etc/services
  iksd foo.bar.edu

   The IKSD command is equivalent to a TELNET command specifying port
   1649. For more information about making and using connections to an
   IKSD, see:

  http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/cuiksd.html

   You can run an Internet Kermit Service on your own computer too (if you
   are the system administrator). For instructions, see:

  http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/iksd.html

SECURITY

   All of C-Kermit's built-in TCP/IP networking methods (Telnet, Rlogin,
   IKSD, FTP, and HTTP) can be secured by one or more of the following
   IETF-approved methods:

     * MIT Kerberos IV
     * MIT Kerberos V
     * SSL/TLS
     * Stanford SRP

   For complete instructions see:

  http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/security.html

   And as noted previously, you can also make SSH connections with
   C-Kermit if you already have an SSH client installed.

ALTERNATIVE COMMAND-LINE PERSONALITIES

   When invoked as "kermit" or any other name besides any of the special
   ones, C-Kermit has the command-line options described above in the
   OPTIONS section. However, if you invoke C-Kermit using any of the
   following names:

     telnet  Telnet client
     ftp     FTP client
     http    HTTP client
     https   Secure HTTP client

   Kermit's command-line personality changes to match. This can be done
   (among other ways) with symbolic links (symlinks). For example, if you
   want C-Kermit to be your regular Telnet client, or the Telnet helper of
   your Web browser, you can create a link like the following in a
   directory that lies in your PATH ahead of the regular telnet program:

  ln -s /usr/local/bin/kermit telnet

   Now when you give a "telnet" command, you are invoking Kermit instead,
   but with its Telnet command-line personality so, for example:

  telnet xyzcorp.com

   Makes a Telnet connection to xyzcorp.com, and Kermit exits
   automatically when the connection is closed (just like the regular
   Telnet client). Type "telnet -h" to get a list of Kermit's
   Telnet-personality command-line options, which are intended to be as
   compatible as possible with the regular Telnet client.

   Similarly for FTP:

  ln -s /usr/local/bin/kermit ftp

   And now type "ftp -h" to see its command-line options, and use command
   lines just like you would give your regular FTP client:

  ftp -n xyzcorp.com

   but with additional options allowing an entire session to be specified
   on the command line, as explained in the C-Kermit FTP client
   documentation.

   And similarly for HTTP:

  ln -s /usr/local/bin/kermit http
  ./http -h
  ./http www.columbia.edu -g kermit/index.html

   Finally, if Kermit's first command-line option is a Telnet, FTP, IKSD,
   or HTTP URL, Kermit automatically makes the appropriate kind of
   connection and, if indicated by the URL, takes the desired action:

  kermit telnet:xyzcorp.com                            ; Opens a Telnet session
  kermit telnet://olga@xyzcorp.com                     ; Ditto for user olga
  kermit ftp://olga@xyzcorp.com/public/oofa.zip        ; Downloads a file
  kermit kermit://kermit.columbia.edu/kermit/f/READ.ME ; Ditto for IKSD
  kermit iksd://kermit.columbia.edu/kermit/f/READ.ME   ; (This works too)
  kermit http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/index.html     ; Grabs a web page
  kermit https://wwws.xyzcorp.com/secret/plan.html     ; Grabs a secure web page
