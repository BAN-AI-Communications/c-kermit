QUICK START FOR FTP USERS

  If you have a Web browser, go to:

    http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/ckermit.html

  And take it from there.  Otherwise...

  The definitive FTP source for Kermit software is kermit.columbia.edu.
  Kermit software obtained from other FTP sites is not necessarily complete
  or up to date, and may have been modified.

C-Kermit for UNIX computers that have a C compiler and 'make' program:

  Directory kermit/archives, binary mode, file cku211.tar.Z or cku211.tar.gz

  This is a compressed tar archive of UNIX C-Kermit source code, makefile, and
  other files.  It unpacks into its current directory, so download it into a
  fresh directory.  Transfer in binary mode, uncompress (or gunzip), untar (tar
  xvf cku211.tar), and then give the appropriate "make" command to build for
  your UNIX system; read the comments in the makefile and ckuins.txt for
  further info.

C-Kermit for VMS:

  If you have VMS UNZIP, get the file kermit/archives/ckv211.zip in binary
  mode, unzip -aa, and build with CKVKER.COM (@ckvker.com).  Read the comments
  at the top of CKVKER.COM for details.

Others:  In the kermit/f or kermit/test directories under the appropriate
prefixes, explained below.


INSTALLATION

Installation procedures depend on the operating system.  Please read the
CK?INS.TXT, if any, file for your operating system (?=U for UNIX, V for VMS,
etc).  Please note the naming and placement for the initialization files:

  CKERMIT.INI
    .kermrc in the user's home directory (UNIX).
    CKERMIT.INI in the user's home directory (other OS's).


  CKERMOD.INI
    .mykermrc in the user's home directory (UNIX).
    CKERMOD.INI elsewhere.

  DIALING DIRECTORIES
    Dialing directory files can be system-wide, per-group, or per-user, or
    any combination.  For example, there can be a corporate wide directory
    shared by all users, a supplemental directory for each division or
    department, and a personal directory for each user.  Simply be sure the
    dialing directory files are identified a SET DIAL DIRECTORY command in
    the user's (or the system-wide) C-Kermit initialization file, or in the
    environment variable (logical name, symbol) K_DIAL_DIRECTORY.  (The
    standard initialization file looks by default in the user's home or login
    directory.)  When installing C-Kermit on multiuser platforms from which
    users will dial out, you can also set environment variables for area
    code, country code, and the various dialing prefixes as described on page
    478 of "Using C-Kermit" (second edition), so users don't have to worry
    about defining these items themselves.   Network directories and service
    directories can also be set up in a similar manner.

  DOCUMENTATION
    In UNIX, the general C-Kermit man page (or one of the versions tailored
    for a specific platform, like HP-UX or Solaris) should be installed in
    the appropriate place.  In VMS, the VMS help topic (CKVKER.HLP) should
    be installed as described in CKVINS.TXT.  Plain-text documentation such
    as CKERMIT2.TXT should be put in whatever place people are accustomed
    to looking.

FILES AND FILE NAMING CONVENTIONS

C-Kermit is a family of Kermit programs for many different computer systems.
The program shares a common set of system-independent file transfer protocol
modules, written in the C language.  System-dependent operations are collected
into system-specific modules for each system.

C-Kermit file names all start with the letters "CK", followed by a single
letter indicating the subgroup.  When referring to these files in the UNIX,
AOS/VS, or VOS environments, use lowercase letters, rather than the uppercase
letters shown here.  Subgroups:

  _: Security/Authentication/Encryption code, possibly regulated by law
  a: General descriptive material and documentation
  b: BOO file encoders and decoders (obsolete)
  c: All platforms with C compilers
  d: Data General AOS/VS
  e: Reserved for "ckermit" files, like CKERMIT.INI, CKERMIT80.TXT
  f: (reserved)
  g: (reserved)
  h: (reserved)
  i: Commodore Amiga (Intuition)
  j: (unused)
  k: (unused)
  l: Stratus VOS
  m: Macintosh with Mac OS
  n: Microsoft Windows NT
  o: OS/2 and/or Microsoft Windows 95/98/ME/NT/2000/XP/...
  p: Bell Labs Plan 9
  q: (reserved)
  r: DEC PDP-11 with RSTS/E (reserved)
  s: Atari ST GEMDOS (last supported in version 5A(189))
  t: DEC PDP-11 with RT-11 (reserved)
  u: UNIX or environments with UNIX-like C libraries
  v: VMS and OpenVMS
  w: Wart (Lex-like preprocessor, used with all systems)
  x: (reserved)
  y: (reserved)
  z: (reserved)
  0-3: (reserved)
  4: IBM AS/400 (reserved but probably never will be used)
  5-8: (reserved)
  9: Microware OS-9

BINARIES

If you have FTP access to kermit.columbia.edu (also known as
kermit.cc.columbia.edu, ftp.cc.columbia.edu), you can also retrieve various
C-Kermit binaries from the directory kermit/bin/ck*.*, or more conveniently
from the web page:

  http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/ck80binaries.html

Test versions would be in kermit/test/bin/ck*.*.  Be sure to transfer these
files in binary mode.  The READ.ME file in that directory explains what's
what.

SOURCE FILES

The source files for the UNIX version (all UNIX versions) are available in
kermit/archives/ckuNNN.tar.Z, approximately 1MB in size.  Transfer this file
in binary mode.  This is a compressed tar archive.  There is also a gzip'd
version, cku211.tar.gz.  To get the binary tar archive:

  mkdir kermit                   (at shell prompt, make a Kermit directory)
  cd kermit                      (make it your current directory)

  ftp kermit.columbia.edu        (make an ftp connection)
  user: anonymous                (log in as user "anonymous", lower case!)
  password:                      (use your email id as a password)
  cd kermit/archives             (go to the archives directory)
  type binary                    (specify binary file transfer)
  get cku300.tar.Z               (get the tar archive) (or get cku192.tar.gz)
  bye                            (disconnect and exit from ftp)

  uncompress cku300.tar.Z        (at the shell prompt, uncompress the archive)
  tar xvf cku300.tar             (extract the files from the tar archive)
  make xxx                       (build C-Kermit for your system)

(where "xxx" is the makefile entry appropriate for your system.)

All C-Kermit source and other text files are also kept separately in the
kermit/f directory.  The files necessary to build a particular implementation
of C-Kermit are listed in the appropriate makefile or equivalent:

       UNIX: makefile (or rename ckuker.mak to makefile)
   2.11 BSD: ckubs2.mak (rename to makefile), ckustr.sed
     Plan 9: ckpker.mk  (rename to mkfile)
  Macintosh: ckmker.mak (rename to kermit.make, use MPW C 3.2)
        VMS: CKVKER.COM (DCL) (and optionally also CKVKER.MMS)
             or CKVOLD.COM (for VMS 4.x)
      Amiga: CKIKER.MAK (Aztec C) or CKISAS.MAK (SAS C)
   Atari ST: CKSKER.MAK
       OS-9: ck9ker.mak or ck9ker.gcc
     AOS/VS: ckdmak.cli, ckdcc.cli, ckdlnk.cli
Stratus VOS: cklmak.cm

Minimal source files for building selected versions (these patterns get all
the files you need, and in some cases maybe a few extra):

   UNIX:   ck[cuw]*.[cwh]   (including QNX, Plan 9, and BeBox)
   UNIX:   ck[cuw_]*.[cwh]  (Unix with security modules)
   VMS:    ck[cuwv]*.[cwh]  VMS
   VMS:    ck[cuwv_]*.[cwh] VMS with SSL/TLS
   Mac:    ck[cuwm]*.[cwhr] Old Mac OS, not Mac OS X, which is UNIX.
   AOS/VS: ck[cuwd]*.[cwh]
   VOS:    ck[cwhl]*.[cwh]
   Amiga:  ck[cuwi]*.[cwh]
   Atari:  ck[cuws]*.[cwh]
   OS-9:   ck[cuw9]*.[cwha]

Finally, here is a more detailed description of the C-Kermit file naming
conventions.  A C-Kermit filename has the form:

  CK<system><what>.<type>

where:

<system> is described earlier in this file;

<type> is the file type (use lowercase on UNIX, VOS, or AOS/VS):

  c:   C language source
  h:   Header file for C language source
  w:   Wart preprocessor source, converted by Wart (or Lex) to a C program
  r:   Macintosh resource file (8-bit text)
  a:   Assembler source

  txt: Plain text.
  nr:  Nroff/Troff text formatter source for UNIX "man page"
  mss: Scribe text formatter source
  ps:  Typeset material to be printed on a PostScript printer

  knd: A Kermit Network Directory
  ksd: A Kermit Services Directory

  mak: A Makefile or other build procedure (often needs renaming)
  com: (VMS only) a DCL command procedure
  cli: (AOS/VS only) a command procedure
  cmd: (OS/2 only) a Rexx command procedure

  boo: "boo"-encoded executable program, decode with CKBUNB program.
  hex: "hex"-encoded executable program, decode with CKVDEH program (VMS only).
  hqx: BinHex'd Macintosh Kermit program, decode with BinHex version 4.0.

  def: An OS/2 linker definitions file.
  sh:  A UNIX shell script.
  sed: A UNIX sed (editor) script.
  str: A file of character strings extracted from C-Kermit (BSD 2.1x only).

<what> is mnemonic (up to 3 characters) for what's in the file:

NOTE: After C-Kermit 6.0, text filetypes such as .DOC and .HLP were changed
to .TXT to avoid confusion in Windows-based Web browsers, which would
otherwise mistake them for Microsoft Word or Windows Help documents.

  ins: Installation instructions or procedures
  bwr: "Beware" file -- things to watch out for, hints and tips
  plm: Program Logic Manual
